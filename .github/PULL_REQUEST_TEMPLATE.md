## Background
Description of what you were asked to do. Try to be as detailed as possible.
The idea is to give enough background to the reviewer to perform the code review.

## Changes done
High level description of what changes you introduced in this PR. Don't bother going into details as they can be seen in the code. Describe _what_ was done, not how or where.

## Pending to be done
What things you left out and why. Maybe you left testing out because the PR was too big already? Maybe you will be following up with a second part with validations? Let your reviewers know!

## Notes
Any design decisions not obvious in the code. Did you have to go outside of our standard? If so, why?

## Demo
Screenshot/video to better understand the idea.\
Include URL ie `http://trial-fe-pr-{THIS_GH_PR_NUMBER}-env.ci-workflow.devicebits.com/`
