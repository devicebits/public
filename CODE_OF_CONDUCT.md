# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct
## Our Pledge
In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as members, contributors, and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members*

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities
Project contributors and maintainers are responsible for clarifying our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Project administrators have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies both within private project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official company e-mail address tied to one's GitHub account, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the organization administrators at [tracy.miller@results-cx.com](mailto:tracy.miler@results-cx.com), which will be addressed by Administrators along with members of the [@devicebits/alpha_team](https://github.com/orgs/devicebits/teams/alpha_team) community team; you may also start a discussion via [@devicebits/Developers](https://github.com/orgs/devicebits/teams/developers). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community members are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
